#### Initial Development Phase ####
The opportunities matrix was used to help decide which items should be included for the initial development phase (phase 1):
Item|Development Phase
----|-----------------
Create an online presence|1
Showcase portfolio of work to potential customers|1
Provide contact information to potential customers|1
Biography|1
Provide link to artist page on comicartfans.com|1
Subscribe|2
Increase social media followers|2
Create a blog|2
Develop online sales capability|3

### Project Scope ###
#### User Demographics ####
* The primary users of the site will be comic art fans. The demographics of comic art fans are quite wide - male and female from ages 5 and up who have an appreciation for comic art.
* A simple, colorful and attractive design would fit this demographic. As the demographic is particularly interested in art and design, the site needs to reflect this and a vibrant and modern design is of high importance.

#### User Requirements ####
* Visually engaging
* Easy to navigate
* The key information should be layed out in a simple, easy to follow and clear way.
* Responsive design is required as users may be viewing the site on Mobile, Tablet or Desktop.

#### User Stories ####
* ***As a user, I want to browse comic art sites for fun and inspiration.***
* ***As a user, I am searching for existing comic art to buy.***
* ***As a user, I am searching for an artist to commission some work.***
* ***As a user, I want to contact the artist.***
* ***As a user, I want to find out more about a specific piece of art.***

#### Constraints #####
* Developer skill set - the developer is currently unable to develop an online sales capability, but this may be considered for future development phases.
* The client is reluctant to create a social media presence on facebook, instagram etc, but does have an artist page on [comicartfans](https://www.comicartfans.com) which should be linked to.
* The client has time constaints on the amount of work he can produce as he has a full time job. We discussed incorporating a Subscribe or Sign Up option, which would allow the artist to produce art and then contact a mailing list of prospective buyers. We decided not to include this feature in phase 1 due to the complications of storing email marketing lists within the constraints of the GDPR regulations.
* The website functional features and background should not be to 'loud' or detract from the main focus of the website, which is presenting the artist's colourful and attractive work.

#### Functional Requirements ####
* The user would like to view a portfolio of the artist's work.
* The user requires contact information to enable them to contact the artist.
* The user potentially requires pricing information. It was decided during the initial stategy meeting with the client that pricing information would not be disclosed on the website, but would be provided on request.

#### Business rules ####
* Copyright notices - all comic book characters are copyright of their respective owners. The copyright notice should appear on each page in the footer.

#### Features ####
The following key features have been identified and scored from 1 - 5 for importance and difficulty. The proposed development phase has also been indicated:

### Site Map ###
A [Site Map](./assets/wireframes/sitemap.png) was produced for discussion prior to the initial project strategy meeting with the client, and is shown below:  
<img src="./assets/wireframes/sitemap.png" style="margin: 15px; width: 400px;">

### Wireframes ###
An [Initial Sketch](./assets/wireframes/rev0) was produced for discussion prior to the initial project strategy meeting with the client and is shown below:  

<img src="./assets/wireframes/rev0/initial-hand-sketch.jpg" style="margin: 15px; width:600px;">

[Initial Wireframes](./assets/wireframes/rev1) showing different options for the [Home]("/assets/wireframes/rev1/home-basecase.png) and [Gallery](./assets/wireframes/rev1/gallery-basecase.png) pages were produced using [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/index.html) and presented to the client. 
The base case was selected for the [Home]("/assets/wireframes/rev1/home-basecase.png) and [Gallery](./assets/wireframes/rev1/gallery-basecase.png) pages and is shown below:  

<img src="./assets/wireframes/rev1/home-basecase.png" style="margin: 15px; width:600px;">  
<img src="./assets/wireframes/rev1/gallery-basecase.png" style="margin: 15px; width:600px;">

[Responsive Design Wireframes](./assets/wireframes/rev2) were then developed based on the initial wireframes showing the [Home](./assets/wireframes/rev2/home-desktop.png), 
[Gallery](./assets/wireframes/rev2/gallery-desktop.png) and [About](./assets/wireframes/rev2/aboutnht-desktop.png) pages as viewed on desktop, tablet and mobile devices. 
The mobile view wireframes are shown below:  

<img src="./assets/wireframes/rev2/home-mobile.png" style="margin: 15px; width:200px;">  
<img src="./assets/wireframes/rev2/gallery-mobile.png" style="margin: 15px; width:200px;">  
<img src="./assets/wireframes/rev2/aboutnht-mobile.png" style="margin: 15px; width:200px;">  

The [Home](./assets/wireframes/rev2/home-desktop.png) page features two large bright and colorful illustrations, a navigation menu, the [NHT logo](./assets/images/nht-logo-300x300.png) provided by the client and 
a link to the artist's page on [comicartfans](https://www.comicartfans.com/gallerydetail.asp?gcat=682). We decided to use two illustrations for the home page 
as the artist's most colourful illustrations are in portrait orientation and this would allow 2 images to be tiled side by side on a desktop view, 
with one of the images being removed or the images being tiled vertically on smaller devices. 

The [Gallery](./assets/wireframes/rev2/gallery-desktop.png) is presented as a seperate page. The [Gallery](./assets/wireframes/rev2/gallery-desktop.png) 
features the artist's favourite work divided into the categories "Illustrations" and "Caricatures". 
The images are tiled in 2 rows corresponding to the "Illustrations" and "Caricatures" categories, 
with 3 columns shown on a desktop view, 2 columns shown on a tablet view and 1 column shown on a mobile view.

The Biography and Contact information is presented on the [About](./assets/wireframes/rev2/aboutnht-desktop.png) page. 
The [About](./assets/wireframes/rev2/aboutnht-desktop.png) page includes a contact button which will open up a contact form.

### Design Choices ###

#### Fonts ####
**Varela Round** has been chosen as the font for all text content. The font is clean and modern and has a soft, rounded feel which ties in well with comic art.
* font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;  

#### Colours ####
The colour pallete was initally chosen based on the red of the [Art Of NHT logo](./assets/images/nht-logo-300x300.png) supplied by the client (#C93C1C). 
The [mycolor](https://mycolor.space) pallete generator tool was used to generate a complementary colour pallete 
based on the logo red (#C93C1C).
The initial colour pallete is shown below:  

<img src="./assets/wireframes/nht-color-light.png" style="margin: 15px; width:600px;">

A screen print of the [Home](index.html) page with the initial colour scheme is shown below:  

<img src="./assets/testing/home-page/home-page-initial-colours.png" style="margin: 15px; width:300px;">

After the home and gallery pages were constructed for review by the client using the colour pallete initially chosen, 
an optional "dark mode" theme was created by the developer, using grey and dark colours for the background and 
functional elements of the website.
The client and developer both preferred the "dark mode" theme, as we felt that this showcased the artist's 
content better and really made the artwork stand out, so this option was selected and developed further into the final website.
The final colour pallete is shown below:  

<img src="./assets/wireframes/nht-color-dark.png" style="margin: 15px; width:600px;">  

* White, used for highlighting
* #FAFAFA - "Cultured", used for headings, highlighting, text and carousel indicators
* #9A9793 - "Spanish Grey", used for navigation links and about page image outline
* #404040 - "Onyx", used for block dividers, home page and gallery image outlines
* #222831 - "Gunmetal", used for background containers
* #D65A31 - "Flame", used for links on about page

## Features ##
### Features Implemented in Phase 1 ###
* [Logo](./assets/testing/home-page/logo.png) (including hover styling, links to home page if selected):  
<img src="./assets/testing/home-page/logo.png" style="margin: 15px; width:100px;">  

* [Navigation Menu](./assets/testing/home-page/navigation-menu.png) (including hover styling):  
<img src="./assets/testing/home-page/navigation-menu.png" style="margin: 15px; width:300px;">  

* [Footer](./assets/testing/home-page/footer.png) with link to artist page on [comicartfans](https://www.comicartfans.com/gallerydetail.asp?gcat=682), (including hover styling):  
<img src="./assets/testing/home-page/footer.png" style="margin: 15px; width:600px;">  

* [Responsive Design](./assets/testing/responsive-design).  

* Large, responsive [Home](index.html) page image(s) which pop out into [Modals](./assets/testing/image-modals) including image title and medium if selected. 
2 images are shown on the [Home](index.html) page on larger devices, and 1 image is shown on the [Home](/index.html) page on smaller devices:  
<img src="./assets/testing/home-page/home-page.png" style="margin: 15px; width:250px;">  
<img src="./assets/testing/image-modals/image-modal-home-page-1.png" style="margin: 15px; width:250px;">    

* Responsive [Gallery](gallery.html) page including bootstrap image carousels to display art categorised into Illustrations and Caricatures. 
The carousels feature 1 image panel on small displays, 2 image panels on medium displays and 3 image panels on large displays. 
The carousel controls are subtly designed and are located under the images so as not to detract from the art, which is the focus of the 
website. The carousels have been set as static (the user has to select left or right to move the images on) as we feel this will improve 
the user experience. The carousel images pop out into [Modals](./assets/testing/image-modals) which include image title and medium if selected:  
<img src="./assets/testing/gallery-page/gallery-page-2.png" style="margin: 15px; width:250px;">  
<img src="./assets/testing/image-modals/image-modal-gallery-page-4.png" style="margin: 15px; width:250px;">  

* [About](about.html) page including artist biography, profile picture, contact links and large, bright call to action "Contact Nick" button. 
Profile picture, "Contact Form" link and "Contact Nick" button all link to the [Contact Form](contact.html). 
The email link creates an email to Nick in the user's default email application:  
<img src="./assets/testing/about-page/about-page.png" style="margin: 15px; width:250px;">  

* [Contact Form](contact.html) containing fields for Name, Email address and Message, and a large Send button. 
If all fields are entered correctly, an email is sent to nickhopet@hotmail.com. This feature is deployed using [Formspree](https://help.formspree.io/hc/en-us):  
<img src="./assets/testing/contact-form/contact-form.png" style="margin: 15px; width:250px;">  

### Features To Be Implemented In Future Development Phases ###
* The [Formspree](https://help.formspree.io/hc/en-us) form submission message can be customised to improve the user experience, however this requires a payed account with [Formspree](https://help.formspree.io/hc/en-us).
This may be considered for implementation in the future, as the free service provided by [Formspree](https://help.formspree.io/hc/en-us) is limited to 50 contact messages per month.
Another future development option would be to submit the contact form via [php](https://www.php.net/). It is not possible to deploy [php](https://www.php.net/) on a site hosted by [GitHub](https://github.com/) pages, 
so the site would need to be moved to another hosting provider that supports [php](https://www.php.net/) in order to implement this.
* Subscribe feature on [Contact Form](contact.html) - this may be implemented in the future if the artist decides to
launch a web marketing campaign.
* Links to social media (dependant on artist being willing to join social media networks).
* Blog - (dependant on artist's time constraints).
* Online Sales Capability - (dependant on developer's technical capability).

### Design Changes During The Phase 1 Development ###
* [Colour Scheme](#colours) - the colour scheme was changed mid-way through the development as described in the [Colours](#colours) section. 
The original colour theme is on the [master](https://github.com/richardhenyash/artofnht/tree/master) branch in the [GitHub](https://github.com/) 
repository. A new [darktheme](https://github.com/richardhenyash/artofnht/tree/darktheme) branch was created for the dark theme option and 
developed into the final website. This is set as the source for [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
* [Gallery](gallery.html) carousel controls - the controls were initially located at the bottom of the images within the image panels, 
but were moved underneath the carousel elements as the developer felt this provided a better user experience. 
See [Gallery Testing Screen Prints](./assets/testing/gallery-page) and example below:  
<img src="./assets/testing/gallery-page/gallery-page-2.png" style="margin: 15px; width:250px;">  

* [Gallery](gallery.html) carousel images - the images were initially being sized by using specific media queries for a range of device widths to set the 
height of the image. The [Gallery](gallery.html) images were then resized to 1200px x 1680px, to enable bootstrap to auto size the gallery in 1 panel, 
2 panels or 3 panels depending on screen size. This enables the gallery to scale fluidly and without degrading image quality for any 
screen size up to 3600px wide. [Gallery Testing Screen Prints](./assets/testing/gallery-page), and example below:  
<img src="./assets/testing/gallery-page/gallery-page-3.png" style="margin: 15px; width:250px;">  

* [Contact Form](contact.html) - the [Contact Form](contact.html) was initially developed as a modal pop-up form, 
but this was found not to work with the [Formspree](https://help.formspree.io/hc/en-us) service. 
The contact form was redesigned as a [web page](contact.html).

## Testing ##

Further testing information and screen prints can be found in [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

## Deployment ##
The project has been developed using [Gitpod](https://www.Gitpod.io/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/). 
The project was regularly commited to [GitHub](https://github.com/) during the initial development phase.
The website resides as a repository in [GitHub](https://github.com/) and has been been deployed on [GitHub](https://github.com/) 
pages using the custom domain [Art Of NHT](www.artofnht.com) purchased from [GoDaddy](https://uk.godaddy.com/).  
For further information on purchasing a custom .com domain from [GoDaddy](https://uk.godaddy.com/) 
see this [Link](https://uk.godaddy.com/tlds/com-domain).
 
Note that the deployed [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) source branch is the [darktheme](https://github.com/richardhenyash/artofnht/tree/darktheme) branch - 
see [Design Changes During The Phase 1 Development](#design-changes-during-the-phase-1-development) for more details.  

The steps required to deploy the website to a custom domain using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) are as follows:
* Open the DNS management page in the [GoDaddy](https://uk.godaddy.com/) Domain Manager 
for the relevant domain which you have purchased through [GoDaddy](https://uk.godaddy.com/).
* Edit the Type "A" record. The IP address in the "Value" field should be changed to 185.199.108.153.
* Edit the Type "CNAME" record with the field "Name" set to "www". This should be changed to the relevant 
[GitHub](https://github.com/) pages web address (username.github.io). For my [GitHub](https://github.com/) pages this is richardhenyash.github.io.
* Add 3 further Type "A" records with "Name" set to "@", and "Value" fields set to IP addresses 185.199.109.153, 185.199.110.153 and 185.199.111.153.
* Go to the [Settings](https://github.com/richardhenyash/artofnht/settings) in the [Project Code Repository Location](https://github.com/richardhenyash/artofnht).
* Scroll to the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) section.
* In the Source section select the [darktheme](https://github.com/richardhenyash/artofnht/tree/darktheme) branch from the dropdown menu.
* In the Custom domain box, add the custom domain name (artofnht.com).
* Tick "Enforce HTTPS".
* This creates a a new file in the root directory called CNAME, which should contain one line of text which is the custom domain name (artofnht.com).

In order to make a fork or clone of the project, a [GitHub](https://www.Gitpod.io/) account is required. 
The [Gitpod Browser Extension](https://www.Gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension/) is also recommended.  

The project may be forked by following these steps:
* Go to the [Project Code Repository Location](https://github.com/richardhenyash/artofnht) on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
* In the top-right corner of the page, click "Fork".  

For further information on forking a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository, 
see the [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

The project may be cloned by following these steps:
* Go to the [Project Code Repository Location](https://github.com/richardhenyash/artofnht) on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
* Select the "Code" dropdown and choose "GitHub CLI" under "Clone". This will give you a URL that may be copied into the clipboard. 
* Open the Git Bash command line interface in [Gitpod](https://www.Gitpod.io/).
* Change the current working directory to the location where you would like the cloned directory to reside.
* Type git clone, and then paste the URL copied earlier, eg:  
$ git clone https://github.com/richardhenyash/artofnht
* Press Enter to create the local clone.

The code may also be downloaded to a local computer by following these steps:
* Go to the [Project Code Repository Location](https://github.com/richardhenyash/artofnht) on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
* Select the "Code" dropdown and choose the "Download ZIP" option.
* This will download a copy of the entire project locally as a .zip file.  

For further information on cloning a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository, see the [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
